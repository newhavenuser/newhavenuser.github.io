<h2><b>Human Healthcare Pipeline</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
The research aligns with human healthcare pipeline, including the clinical diagnosis, surgery intervention and medical foundation models. With the multimodal medical data from patient examinations, our research can assist clinicans with diagnosis and assist surgeons with surgery. In particular, our research on multimodal medical foundation models can further support the entire healthcare pipeline.

<h2><b>Multimodal Clinical Diagnosis</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Our research targets at the multimodal clinical diagnosis through AI training pipeline. The research focuses on addressing significant clinical challenges caused by imperfect medical data, including the low-quality data, modality-missing data, decentralized data, and coarse/noisy annotations. The research has been verified on diverse modalities, such as endoscopy, dermoscopy, pathology, radiology, ophthalmology, genetics, etc.

<h2><b>Surgery Intervention Assistance</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
We have developed a surgeon-centric Surgery Copilot system to provide comprehensive assistance throughout the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative processes. By understanding the surgeon's intention through voice commands, our Surgery Copilot system can automatically execute of various advanced surgical understanding algorithms, and further support surgical pipeline automation and embodied ultrasound scanning. The research enhances precision, efficiency, and safety in surgical intervention.

<h2><b>Medical Foundation Models</b></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Besides the diganosis and surgery, our research is exploring on medical foundation models to support more stages in human healthcare pipeline. Namely, these stages include triage, imaging, diagnosis, treatment, surgery, and rehabilitation, covering the entire spectrum of patient care. By driving the evolution of medical foundation models across these stages, our goal is to create a more seamless, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare system.
